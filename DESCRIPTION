Description: Social network analysis is becoming increasingly popular in many
     social science disciplines, but access to useful network data, especially 
     among marginalized populations, still remains a large obstacle. Using this 
     package, it is possiblt to mitigate this problem by simulating spatial 
     Bernoulli networks as orignially proposed by Carter T Butts (2002). To that 
     end, spacejamr allows network analysts to simulate spatial Bernoulli 
     networks by generating a spatial point process with a given number of 
     "nodes" or points in a given geographical area; calculate the probability 
     that any two nodes share a tie using either a standard power law or 
     attenuated power law spatial interaction function; and
     generate a network object. Additionally, the package also provides simple 
     to use plotting methods for its classes that return ggplot objects.
