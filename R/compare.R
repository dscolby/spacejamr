# Purpose: Provide a function to compare two simulated networks


#' Compare statistics from two simulated networks
#'
#' @description Generates summary statistics for two simulated networks of class
#' NetSim.
#'
#' @usage compare_networks(net1, net2)
#'
#' @details This function enables a quick comparison of two simulated networks
#' of class NetSim. This allows the user to see how different a network
#' simulated from a Halton sequence is from network simulated from a Poisson
#' point process with the same number of points in the same geographical window.
#' Similarly, it enables comparison of networks generated from different
#' spatial interaction functions. The density, mean degree, mean closeness, mean
#' betweenness, and the size of the largest connected component are computed for
#' each network.
#'
#' @param net1 a NetSim object
#' @param net2 a NetSim object
#'
#' @return A dataframe with two rows and five columns. The first row displays
#' statistics from the first network and the second row displays statistics from
#' the second network. The values in each column are as follows. Density: the
#' density of the network. Mean Degree: the average degree of all nodes in the
#' network. Mean Closeness: the average closeness centrality of all nodes in
#' each network. Mean Betweenness: the average betweenness centrality for the
#' nodes in a network. Largest Component Size: The number of nodes in the
#' largest connected component of a network.

#' # load data
#' data("RI")

#' # Simulate point processes
#' points1 <- PointSim(10, RI)
#' points2 <- PointSim(20, RI)
#'
#' # Create two networks
#' net1 <- NetSim(points1)
#' net2 <- NetSim(points2)
